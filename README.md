# CSS calc() Function Error with String Variables

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur when using CSS variables (custom properties) within the `calc()` function. The error arises when attempting to perform mathematical operations on CSS variables holding string values instead of numeric values. 

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue is explained in detail in the files themselves.
